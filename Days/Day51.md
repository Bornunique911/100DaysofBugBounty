2. **Fawn :-** This One machine is all about FTP protocol . Intresting as i got to first time how we can connect using ftp and use it download file using ftp.

3. **Dancing :-** Dancing machine is about smb . IT teach me how to use smbclient to connect on smbport 445/139 how to list shares & to download flag file lol.
