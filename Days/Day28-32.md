Now I'm eagerly waiting for hackevent result . Got clearity toward my vision and learning path after participating in event form now on my prime focus would be on ( HTB, PentesterLab, web sec academy, BBH ,HTB Academy , will complete some room of tryhackme but it will not be in prime focus .).

Also i made a promise to myself that i will give my best to remain as excited in learning proccess as i was during hackevent.
