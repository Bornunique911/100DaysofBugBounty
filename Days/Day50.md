## CTF
yogosha ctf challange haven't got succed yet. found intresting info such as cookie are base64 encrypted with user name and containing csrf token. on /index.html page it says if it typed manually look for spelling but didn't work . tried manuplating cookie with admin name that didn't work as well. after registration some parameter  such as id  is seeming phishy  but haven't figured it out yet what can be done with this.
